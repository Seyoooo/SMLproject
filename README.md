# Project : Box-office score prediction

**Course:** Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning - Project

**Team Limoncello**: Iga Pawlak, Julien Horvat

## 1. Description

This project is a serverless ML pipeline that creates models for upcoming box office performance predictions of recently released films. The model is trained on well selected features of past films and solving a regression problem tries to infer on the revenue of new films. The datasource we chose is the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started), an online API giving a free access to a good amount of film description, frequently updated, and with performant and interesting query possibilities. One can get the access via an online formula. 

The pipeline use Hopsworks features and models stores, and Huggingface web app for user interface.
